## Authentication

| Operation | Method | Path | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| Grant Token | POST | `https://auth.ocrolus.com/oauth/token` | OAuth 2.0 client_credentials grant; returns JWT; 24h expiry |

**Request:** `grant_type=client_credentials`, `client_id`, `client_secret` (form-encoded)
**Response:** `{ "access_token": "...", "token_type": "Bearer", "expires_in": 86400 }`
**All subsequent requests:** `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

## Book Operations (v1, uses `pk` integer)

| Operation | Method | Path | Status |
|-----------|--------|------|--------|
| Create Book | POST | `/v1/book/add` | CORRECTED — `/v1/book/create` returns 404; `/v1/books` POST returns list only |
| Delete Book | POST | `/v1/book/delete` | CONFIRMED |
| Update Book | POST | `/v1/book/update` | CONFIRMED |
| Get Book Info | GET | `/v1/book/{pk}` | CONFIRMED |
| List Books | GET | `/v1/books` | CONFIRMED |
| Get Book Status | GET | `/v1/book/status?book_pk={pk}` | CONFIRMED — both query-param and path-param `/v1/book/{pk}/status` work |
| Get Book from Loan | GET | `/v1/book/loan/{loan_id}` | CONFIRMED |
| Get Loan from Book | GET | `/v1/book/{pk}/loan` | CONFIRMED |

**Important corrections:**
- The create endpoint is `/v1/book/add` (NOT `/v1/book/create`). Accepts JSON body `{"name": "..."}`. Returns `pk`, `uuid`, `book_type`.
- Both Book Status styles work: query param (`?book_pk=X`) and path param (`/{pk}/status`).
- The upload field name for book identifier is `pk` (NOT `book_pk`).

- Max file size: **200 MB**
- `form_type` param is optional; cannot be used for bank statements
- Plaid Asset Import uses audit copy token (production only; `auditor_id: "ocrolus"`)

## Optima -- Real-Time Extraction (separate host)

> **Note:** These endpoints use a different base URL (`apika.ocrolus.com`) and are not linked
> from the main Ocrolus docs navigation. They were discovered via direct URL:
> [optima-capture](https://docs.ocrolus.com/reference/optima-capture),
> [optima-capture-images](https://docs.ocrolus.com/reference/optima-capture-images).

| Operation | Method | Path | Content-Type |
|-----------|--------|------|-------------|
| Classify + Capture (PDF) | POST | `https://apika.ocrolus.com/ml/v2/instant` | `application/pdf` |
| Classify + Capture (Images) | POST | `https://apika.ocrolus.com/ml/v2/instant/images` | `multipart/form-data` |

**How Optima differs from the standard pipeline:**
- **No book required** — documents are not stored; results returned immediately
- **No human verification** — pure ML extraction
- **Same auth** — uses the same OAuth Bearer token from `auth.ocrolus.com`
- **Use case:** Quick validation (confirm doc type, check if a field is present) rather than full processing

**Validated:** 2026-03-31 — both endpoints return `415` (correct content-type required), confirming routes are live and authenticated.
